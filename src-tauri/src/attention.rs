//! Getting your attention when the overlay itself cannot.
//!
//! The whole point of this app is that you can glance at it while doing
//! something else. But a maximised video or a full-screen editor covers it
//! completely, and then a finished turn goes unnoticed until you happen to
//! look. The tray icon is the one surface that stays reachable, so a
//! completion blinks it.
//!
//! Small and interruptible: it blinks for a few seconds, any
//! click stops it, and Do Not Disturb suppresses it entirely.

# Building and releasing

[← README](../../README.md)

## Build

Needs Node 20+ and a Rust toolchain everywhere, plus the platform's own
prerequisites.

**Windows:** the MSVC C++ build tools.

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** Tauri is a GTK and WebKit application, and none of
that is installed by default.

```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
                 librsvg2-dev libxdo-dev libssl-dev build-essential \
                 patchelf file
```

`libwebkit2gtk-4.1` specifically — Tauri v2 does not use the 4.0 series. Fedora
wants `webkit2gtk4.1-devel`, `libappindicator-gtk3-devel`, `librsvg2-devel` and
`libxdo-devel`. Then, on either:

```bash
npm install
npm run sprites
npm run app:build
```

That produces `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.AppImage` under
`src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`, or the NSIS and MSI installers on Windows.
`--bundles deb` and friends narrow it down when only one is wanted.

`npm run app:dev` runs it with hot reload.

`npm run dev` serves the frontend alone in a browser, with a demo loop standing
in for real sessions. `?panel=welcome` and `?panel=doctor` render those panels
so they can be worked on without a build or a broken machine to point them at.

## The README animation

```bash
npm run demo
```

Paints a flat backdrop over the screen, runs the release build against an
isolated profile driven by `tools/simulate.mjs`, captures frames, and crops to
the pixels that actually changed, so re-recording it needs no judgement about
what happens to be on your desktop, and nothing of yours ends up in a public
README. Windows only; the capture is a `CopyFromScreen` through PowerShell.

`--frames`, `--interval`, `--lead` and `--backdrop` control it. The output is an
animated PNG rather than a GIF: 256 colours band the backdrop badly, and the
encoder is a few chunks on top of the PNG writer the sprite pipeline already
has.

## Tests

```bash
npm test                                   # the pure display logic and the pet manifests
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
npm run check:sprites                      # the atlases still match their generators
```

`check:sprites` regenerates the atlases and compares them to the committed ones
**by pixel**, then puts the committed bytes back. Not by file: a PNG ends in a
deflate stream, and two zlib builds handed identical pixels emit different
bytes for them, so a file comparison passes on whichever machine generated the
atlas and fails on every other one.

The JavaScript tests run under Node's own runner. No framework, no config
file. `src/derive.js` holds every judgement about whether a card is telling the
truth, kept apart from rendering so it can be tested without a
window, and every function takes `now` so the awkward moments can be examined
rather than waited for.

What is *not* tested: transparent windows, the tray, the hit testing, and
anything that needs a real Claude Code session. Those are checked by hand
against the release checklist below.

## Releasing

1. Bump the version in `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and
   `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Write `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`.
2. `npm run verify:release` asserts all three agree, that the notes exist, and
   that the tag matches.
3. `npm test && cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
4. Push the tag. `release` opens the draft, then builds Windows and Linux in
   parallel, running the same tests, clippy and fmt gates on each before either
   is allowed to bundle. The Linux job runs on **ubuntu-22.04** on purpose:
   glibc is forward-compatible and not backward, so the runner's version is the
   floor for everyone who downloads the result, and 22.04 is the oldest image
   that still carries webkit2gtk-4.1.
5. Work through the checklist, then publish the draft. Six assets: `.exe` and
   `.msi` from Windows, `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.AppImage` from Linux.

### Release checklist

Anything not verified on real hardware is recorded as such in the notes rather
than assumed.

**Every platform**

- [ ] Fresh install: the welcome panel appears once, installs the hooks, and
      does not come back after Done, the close button, or a restart.
- [ ] Upgrade from the previous version: the pet is where it was left, and the
      existing `config.json` is neither reset nor rewritten.
- [ ] A session start, a tool call, a permission prompt, and a completion each
      reach the card within about a third of a second.
- [ ] Killing Claude Code mid-turn retires the card within ~10s rather than
      leaving it "running".
- [ ] Setup check: all green, and the connection test reports the session you
      ran during it.
- [ ] Clicks pass through the transparent area to whatever is underneath.
- [ ] Uninstall removes the hooks from `~/.claude/settings.json`.

**Windows**

- [ ] No console window flashes on any menu action or hook.
- [ ] Tray blink on completion, and clicking the tray stops it.
- [ ] Start with Windows survives a reboot.
- [ ] Dragging to a second monitor, then unplugging it, leaves the pet reachable.

**Linux**

- [ ] The `.deb` installs and `pipsqueak` is on `PATH`.
- [ ] The `.AppImage` runs from a fresh download, and the hook command it
      registers in `~/.claude/settings.json` is the path of the AppImage file
      itself — not a `/tmp/.mount_*` path, which is gone the moment it quits.
- [ ] `~/.config/autostart/pipsqueak.desktop` appears on first run and the pet
      is there after a log out and back in.
- [ ] Clicks land on the cards and pass through everywhere else, on Wayland and
      on X11.
- [ ] The pet survives a display-scale change without shrinking.

**macOS**

- [ ] Builds at all. If there is no hardware to check on, say so in the notes.

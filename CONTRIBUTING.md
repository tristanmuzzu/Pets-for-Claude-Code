# Contributing

Bug reports, pets, and pull requests are all welcome. It is a small project and
will stay one.

## Reporting something broken

Right-click the pet → **Check my setup** → **Copy report**, and paste that into
the issue. It contains the version, the platform, and which of the four checks
failed; it contains no paths, prompts, or file contents.

If the pet is showing something untrue — a completion that had not happened,
work that had stopped, a card stuck on "needs you" — that is the most valuable
kind of report this project can get, and worth more detail than usual: what you
were running, and what the card said versus what was actually going on.

## Building

```bash
npm install
npm run sprites
npm run app:dev
```

`npm run dev` serves the frontend alone in a browser with a demo loop standing
in for real sessions, which is the fastest way to work on anything visual.
`?panel=welcome` and `?panel=doctor` render those panels directly.

Full detail in [docs/project/building.md](docs/project/building.md).

## Before opening a pull request

```bash
npm test
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

CI runs the same thing, plus a check that the sprite atlases still match their
generators.

## What the code is trying to be

A few things that are load-bearing rather than stylistic, so a change that
reverses one is probably a bug:

- **The hooks never write to stdout.** Anything printed on `PermissionRequest`
  becomes a permission decision. Nothing this app does may change what Claude
  Code decides.
- **Nothing is claimed that has not been established.** If an event is
  ambiguous, the card keeps saying what it was saying. Silence is always better
  than a confident wrong answer.
- **The display logic lives in `src/derive.js`**, apart from rendering, and
  takes `now` as an argument. That is what makes the debounces and holds
  testable rather than something you have to sit and watch.
- **Nothing moves without meaning.** Motion in the corner of someone's eye is a
  claim that something happened.
- **No new dependencies without a reason that survives the question "what would
  it take to do this by hand?"** The Rust side talks to Windows through a
  handful of declared functions rather than a crate graph; the sprite pipeline
  encodes its own PNGs.

## Pets

A pet is a folder with a `pet.json` and a spritesheet — see
[docs/guides/custom-pets.md](docs/guides/custom-pets.md). If you make one you
are happy to share, open a PR adding it to `public/pets/`, ideally with a
generator alongside it so it can be regenerated and colour-tweaked.

Please don't submit pets built from someone else's logo, mascot, or branding.
What you run on your own machine is your business; what ships in this repo has
to be original.

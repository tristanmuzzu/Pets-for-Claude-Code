/**
 * Take the hint down, and cancel one that has not appeared yet.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR
 *
 * The hint used to be dismissed by `pointerleave` alone, and that event does
 * not arrive. The window only accepts the cursor where the pet and its cards
 * are; step off the pet and the compositor routes the pointer to whatever is
 * underneath, so the page is told nothing — no leave, no out, and `:hover`
 * stays stuck on. Measured on GNOME 50.1 / Wayland, 2026-08-18, by counting
 * events while moving the pointer off the pet: `pet-pointerenter:1
 * pet-pointerover:1 hov:1` before, the same after, nothing added by the move.
 *
 * So the hint could appear seconds after the cursor had left, and then sit
 * there. What does know is one layer down: GTK gets the Wayland leave, and
 * `pipsqueak://pointer-left` carries it up. On the platforms that hit-test by
 * polling the cursor instead, `pipsqueak://cursor` answers the same question.

 *
 * `pointerenter` cannot be trusted to say this either, and for the mirror
 * reason: the page is never told the cursor left, so as far as WebKit is
 * concerned it never did, and coming back produces no crossing event at all.
 * One drag was enough to poison it for good — dragging the pet takes the
 * pointer out of the window under a grab, and afterwards the pet neither
 * jumped nor showed its hint again, however many times the cursor arrived.
 * Movement is the reliable signal, so arrival is read from that, and `hovering`
